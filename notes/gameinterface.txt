How could the general game interface work:

-> view all finality states of game
-> view finality of current state
-> view current state (full)
-> view array of players (addresses)
-> view count of players
-> view current player (the index, not the address itself, because players could repeat)
-> view list of legal moves

# Open Questions

Should we encode surrendering as a move?
That could abstract the logic further and make it easier to interface with other games.
Chess would not "agree" that that's a chess move, but the way the interface treats moves is different than chess.
Don't do this for now, wait until we have more info on other games and if this would be useful or not

Should we encode the "finality" into the "current state"? Or leave it separate?
I lean towards keeping it separate.

Should we separate, include, etc the count of plys?
No opinion, so I rather not include it.

Should we abstract the notion of player?
By having an array of felts (addresses) to index players.
The alternative is keeping track of white and black as two felts.

Should we ditch the idea of the arbiter?
I think it would be pretty useful for letting other external conditions (time, other rules, etc) be able to decide the outcome, optionally.
And you could do this more complex behaviour like time keeping with a wrapper contract that takes care of it, and also respects the game interface itself.

Some other thoughts I had.
Getting the current state of the game is probably not feasible,
because the full state is unbounded. So, for games like chess,
you should make a distinction between parts of state that are
bounded (like the "state" as we refer in the contract), which
is the state that the contract will return and usually deal with.

And you can have other extra, non-interface features for unbounded
state. Still, more experience with building other games is necessary
to get the feel of what would make an useful interface and what not.
