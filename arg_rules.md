### Spirit

The objective of curated evidence is to provide a high signal to noise ratio for jurors. Jurors should be able to see true evidence and valid arguments on both sides.

### Succintness

Arguments should be succint

- Must not include insults directed to parties involved in the dispute
- Must not include verbosity
- - Must not include excessive adjectives
- - Must not include valorative adjectives
- Should be expressed in short, logical sentences

### Clarity

Arguments should be as clear and direct as possible

- Words should have clear meaning. Words should not have ambiguous meaning. Words must not have various contradictory meanings, if the resultant confusion is relevant to the context of the case.
- Must be a single argument. Multiple arguments must be submitted separately.

### Truthness

Arguments must be true.

### No redundancy

Arguments should not be redundant.

- Must not be 

### Relation to the case

Arguments must stay focused on the case

- Must not reference items unrelated to the case
- Should not reference items peripherally related to the case. If so, a (succint) justification of why the argument is necessary must be added. If the item is peripherally related to the case, and included in this list, it must not be accepted:
- - Kleros meta: The validity, reputation, or future of Kleros. Or, the value of the token Kleros is using.
